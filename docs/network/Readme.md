## Overview

In flutter, we are using Dio package for http client.

Dio is a powerful HTTP client for dart, which supports Interceptors, Global configuration, FormData, Request

retrofit.
By comparing the http package with Dio, Dio provides an intuitive API for performing advanced network tasks with
minimal effort.
