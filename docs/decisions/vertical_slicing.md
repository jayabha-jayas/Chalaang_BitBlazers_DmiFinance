### Recommendation

In this Flutter starter kit we are using Vertical Slicing for software development because in Vertical Slicing each resulting story provides some sort of meaningful value to the user. This not only makes them easier to test, but they also become easier for the customer to interact with to provide feedback and guidance for our next sprint.
