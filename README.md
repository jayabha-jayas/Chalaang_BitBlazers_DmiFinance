## Introduction

- Flutter catalyst is an opinionated code structure along with recommended coding practices to spread common
  pattern and practices followed in the community.
- A decent local dev set up, CI/CD setup and detailed documentation for all the features.
- As part of version `2.0.0`, setup for E2E testing, Code Obfuscation with Proguard, Adopting to Material 3 Library along with few bug fixes has been done.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Flutter - 3.7.11
- Dart - 2.19.6
- Xcode - 13.4, iOS 15
- Cocoapods
- Android Studio and Android SDK(21-31)

Refer [Flutter environment setup](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to setup all prerequisites (select Windows / MacOS and follow instructions according to your OS).

### Getting Started

1. For NEO users download the repo using `Download source code` button on top right.
2. Install melos
    ```shell
   flutter pub global activate melos 2.9.0
   ```
3. Install Dependencies
   To install flutter dependencies run the following commands

    ```shell
    flutter pub global run melos bootstrap
    ```

   or we can use make commands that are already configured

    ```shell
    make bootstrap
    ```
4. Get the list of devices
   This command will help to get list devices running the machine
    ```shell
    make list-devices
   ```
5. Run the app
   To Run the application, give the prefix of the device
    ```shell
   make app/<DEVICE PREFIX>
   ```
   Default Flavor and Build Type is development and debug respectively. We can change them by passing FLAVOR and B_TYPE
   in make command as follows:

    ```shell
    make app/<DEVICE PREFIX> FLAVOR=<FLAVOR> B_TYPE=<Build_Type>
    ```

**`Note:`** To perform various operations like format, test, analyze you can refer to [Makefile](Makefile).

### Credentials for login

Once application gets started, it renders the login page. Logging to the application using following credentials

  ```
  User Id : derek
  Password : jklg*_56
  ```
NOTE: Check the right corner of the `Appbar` to change the `Language and Theme`.

**`Observations on E2E Setup:`**
- As we have basic setup for integration test, we have not setup workflows for it. User can setup integration pipeline according to the requirement.
- As observed during running integration test on pipeline, there is complication to get stable Device configuration. Somehow it works with Android 11(most stable with Pixel 2 api 30). Upgraded version of devices give different issues in test cases.
- Test cases behaves flaky and gives error "Bad state: No element", but issue gets resolve when use certain time delay. (pump() and pumpAndSettle).

## ADR

Please refer [decisions](docs/decisions) folder to learn more about our tech choices and more detailed comparisons.

**`Note:`**
For security reasons we have deleted google-service.json and GoogleService-Info.plist file from the project.

If there is need of push notification and other things that required firebase usages. We need to add google-service.json and GoogleService-Info.plist files in native layer to set firebase sdk.
For more information you refer Firebase SDK setup documentation (docs/firebase_sdk_setup/firebase_sdk_setup.md).
